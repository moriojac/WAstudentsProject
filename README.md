        <h6 style="text-align: center; min-height: 150px; font-size: 2px;">
          For this project, data was collected from two primary sources: an NBA injury catalog and an NBA stats catalog, which can be found below.

        <b>Data Cleaning and Preparation</b>
        <h6 style="text-align: center; min-height: 150px;">
          - Filtering Data: Only relevant years (2010-2017) were kept for both stats and injury datasets.
         <br><br> - Removing Unnecessary Columns: Duplicate and irrelevant columns were dropped.
         <br><br> - Standardizing Column Names: Column names were standardized to ensure consistency across datasets.
         <br><br> - Merging Datasets: Data was merged on key attributes—Year, Player, and Team.

        <b>Data Visualization & Storytelling</b>
        <h6 style="text-align: center; min-height: 150px;">
          Data is manipulated into several visualizations, categorized into three sections:
         <br><br> - Injury Visualization: Providing a comprehensive view of injuries sustained.
         <br><br> - Change Over Time: Revealing injury growth, pointing to the need for better injury prevention.
         <br><br> - Contrast: Identifying injury risks based on physical attributes and performance metrics.

        <b>Interpretation & Decision-Making</b>
        <h6 style="text-align: center; min-height: 150px;">
          The goal of this data is to offer insights that assist professionals in injury prevention, allowing the reader to interpret and make decisions based on the findings.
         <br><br> Insights from the data can help teams develop targeted injury prevention strategies, such as load management for high-minute players and conditioning/workout programs based on position-             specific vulnerabilities.
